# Docker, .NET Core, macOS: An Unusual Introduction to Docker

Download the following installers:

- [Docker](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

If you are feeling ambitious, continue with the next steps
- Install Docker (you don't need to create an account for this excercise)
- Go to the terminal and run the following commands (these download official microsoft images that are fairly large so it's good to get a head start on them)
```bash
docker pull microsoft/aspnetcore
docker pull microsoft/aspnetcore-build
```
- Install .NET Core SDK

Note: If you have any terminal windows open you may have to close them and reopen new ones so that the dotnet commands are added to your path.
